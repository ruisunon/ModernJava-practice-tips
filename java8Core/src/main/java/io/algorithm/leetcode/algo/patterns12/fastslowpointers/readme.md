How do you identify when to use the Fast and Slow pattern?





The problem will deal with a loop in a linked list or array
When you need to know the position of a certain element or the overall length of the linked list.
When should I use it over the Two Pointer method mentioned above?

There are some cases where you shouldn’t use the Two Pointer approach such as in a singly linked list where you can’t move in a backwards direction. An example of when to use the Fast and Slow pattern is when you’re trying to determine if a linked list is a palindrome.
Problems featuring the fast and slow pointers pattern:

Linked List Cycle (easy)
Palindrome Linked List (medium)
Cycle in a Circular Array (hard)
